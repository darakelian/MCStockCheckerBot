# MCStockCheckerBot
Simple bot for commenting on the stocks of items posted on /r/buildapcsales from microcenter.com

This bot currently runs on my own server and is configured to use my own API keys. You could host this yourself but it would be pretty
redundant to have two bots doing the same thing.

Made with Python and Praw
